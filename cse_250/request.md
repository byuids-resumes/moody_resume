# Final Request and Review Letter

## Great class

I came into this from a statistics/R background. I had some python experience, but not data science and I now see the crucial need for python data science skills. At first it was a learning curve, but I am now more familiar with many data manipulation and visualization packages. I plan to, and already have used these skills for real work. 

I also highly enjoyed Bro Hathaway's lectures. They realistically portray academia for what it is... of little use. 

Changes to the class:

- Make some of the hyperlinks to other websites more userfriendly by forcing a new tab using `target="_blank"`.

```
<a href="link" target="_blank">text</a>
```
- put the machine learning project later (or just remove it entirely)

## How I did

I got 5/5 on 3 projects and 4/5 on 2 projects. I did pretty well on the quizzes. I did a [Facebook marketplace scraping project](https://github.com/byuids-resumes/moody_resume/tree/master/Facebook%20Marketplace%20Project) to test these skills. I got 4/4 on the coding challenge. I attended DSS once, but not for very long because it was on zoom so I couldn't socialize. I believe I got the point of this class so I request an `A`.
